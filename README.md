# Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Detection and Diagnosis System

## Overview

This repository contains the code and models developed for the early detection and confirmatory diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using a combination of deep learning and machine learning techniques. The project is focused on providing a lightweight, easy-to-deploy system suitable for use in low-resource settings to assist in the early identification of autism in children.
